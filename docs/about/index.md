# Introduction
My main efforts today are in the field of cosmology.

"What is Cosmology?" you may ask... Cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe as a whole. As a theorist, my job is to come up with new theories, or evaluate the validity of existing ones, and what implications they have on the evolution of our 14 billion year old universe.

As a member of Dark Matter McGill (DMcGill) a lot of my work revolves around theoretical particle physics models of dark matter. More recently, I've been working on topological defects in cosmology, which are peculiar structures predicted to be formed in the early universe by many theories.
