Cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe as a whole. As a theorist, my job is to come up with new theories, or evaluate the validity of existing ones, and what implications they have on the evolution of our 14 billion year old universe.</p> <p>As a member of Dark Matter McGill (DMcGill) a lot of my work revolves around theoretical particle physics models of dark matter. More recently, I've been working on topological defects in cosmology, which are peculiar structures predicted to be formed in the early universe by many theories.</p> <p>You can find my most research work at Publications</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Powerlifting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":"<p>Up to date as of October 2024</p>"},{"location":"about/powerlifting/","title":"Amateur Powerlifting","text":"<p>Aside from my scientific interests, I train for powerlifting 6 days a week, every week.

These stars, known as mirror stars, can gravitational capture ordinary matter and superheat them to detectable ranges. My work focused on the theoretical modelling of these stars, followed by a numerical simulation of their signatures. For this analysis, I used the Digital Research Alliance of Canada's Niagara Supercomputer located at the University of Toronto.</p> <p>My current work is in topological defects in cosmology, specifically the signatures of domain walls created during phase transitions in the early universe.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#recent-highlights","title":"Recent Highlights","text":"<ul> <li>\"Electromagnetic Signatures of Mirror Stars\" Berkin Gurbuz, et al., 2024</li> </ul> <p>A full list of publications can be found here.</p>"}]}
