Cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe as a whole. As a theorist, my job is to come up with new theories, or evaluate the validity of existing ones, and what implications they have on the evolution of our 14 billion year old universe.</p> <p>As a member of Dark Matter McGill (DMcGill) a lot of my work revolves around theoretical particle physics models of dark matter. More recently, I've been working on topological defects in cosmology, which are peculiar structures predicted to be formed in the early universe by many theories.</p>"},{"location":"#here-is-me-and-my-best-bud","title":"Here is me and my best bud!","text":""},{"location":"about/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Blablabla cosmology blablabla</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Powerlifting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/powerlifting/","title":"How to cook toast","text":"<p>Put bread into toaster and hope.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/","title":"Research Interests","text":"<p>Here is a paragraph explaining my research interests, the telescopes that I'm involved in or which I use. </p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#recent-highlights","title":"Recent Highlights","text":"<ul> <li>Awesome Paper</li> <li>Multiwavelength Paper</li> </ul> <p>A full list of publications can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/all_publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"reasearch/all_publications/#2023","title":"2023","text":"<ul> <li>The effect of lactose intolerance on future lunar exploration.
